Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On August 14, 2012, in connection with the previously announced private offering, Prospect Capital Corporation (\"Prospect\", \"Company\", \"we\" or \"our\") issued $200 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the \"Notes\") under an indenture, dated as of August 14, 2012 (the \"Indenture\"), between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee (the \"Trustee\").  Barclays Capital Inc., as initial purchaser of the Notes, was also granted an option to purchase an additional $30 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Notes will mature on March 15, 2018, unless previously converted in accordance with their terms. The Notes will be general unsecured obligations of Prospect, will rank equally in right of payment with Prospect\\'s existing and future senior unsecured debt (including Prospect\\'s outstanding 6.25% convertible senior notes due 2015, 5.5% convertible senior notes due 2016, 5.375% convertible senior notes due 2017, 6.95% senior notes due 2022, and any Prospect Capital InterNotes outstanding), and will rank senior in right of payment to any potential subordinated debt, should any be issued in the future. The interest rate on the Notes is 5.75% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing March 15, 2013.  As described in the Indenture, holders may convert their Notes at any time on or prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date at an initial conversion rate of 82.3451 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $12.14 per share). The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain events. Upon conversion, unless a holder converts after a record date for an interest payment but prior to the corresponding interest payment date, the holder will receive a separate cash payment with respect to the Notes surrendered for conversion representing accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including the conversion date. Any such payment will be made on the settlement date applicable to the relevant conversion on the Notes. No holder of Notes will be entitled to receive shares of our common stock upon conversion to the extent (but only to the extent) that such receipt would cause such converting holder to become, directly or indirectly, a \"beneficial owner\" (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) of more than 5.0% of the shares of our common stock outstanding at such time (the \"Limitation\"). Any purported delivery of shares of our common stock upon conversion of Notes shall be void and have no effect to the extent (but only to the extent) that such delivery would result in the converting holder becoming the beneficial owner of more than the Limitation. If any delivery of shares of our common stock owed to a holder upon conversion of Notes is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of the Limitation, our obligation to make such delivery shall not be extinguished and we shall deliver such shares as promptly as practicable after any such converting holder gives notice to us that such delivery would not result in it being the beneficial owner of more than 5.0% of the shares of common stock outstanding at such time. The Limitation shall no longer apply following the effective date of any \"fundamental change\" (as defined in the Indenture). Subject to certain exceptions, holders may require the Company to repurchase, for cash, all or part of their Notes upon a  \"fundamental change\" (as defined in the Indenture) at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the \"fundamental change repurchase date\" (as defined in the Indenture). The Indenture contains certain events of default, the occurrence of which may lead to the Notes being due and payable immediately.  The events of default contained in the Indenture include, without limitation, the following: failure by the Company to pay any interest on the Notes when due and such failure continues for a period of 30 calendar days; failure by the Company to pay principal of the Notes when due at the maturity date, or failure by the Company to pay the repurchase price payable, in respect of any Notes when due; failure by the Company to deliver shares of common stock upon the conversion of any Notes and such failure continues for five calendar days following the scheduled settlement date for such conversion; failure by the Company to issue a \"fundamental change company notice\" (as defined in the Indenture) on a timely basis in accordance with the Indenture; a failure to pay principal when due (whether at stated maturity or otherwise), or an uncured default that results in the acceleration of maturity, of any indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company or any of its \"significant subsidiaries\" (asdefined in the Indenture) in an aggregate amount in excess of $20,000,000 (or its foreign currency equivalent), unless such indebtedness is discharged, or such acceleration is rescinded, stayed or annulled, within a period of 30 calendar days after written notice of such failure or uncured default is given to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding; default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of the Company in the Indenture with respect to any Note (other than certain covenants or warranties as described in the Indenture), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 60 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding securities of that series a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a \"notice of default\" (as defined in the Indenture); and certain events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or its \"significant subsidiaries\" (as defined in the Indenture). The foregoing summary of the Indenture set forth above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Indenture, a copy of which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K (\"Form 8-K\") as Exhibit 4.1 and incorporated herein by reference. Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant. The information set forth under Item 1.01 of this Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference. Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities. The information set forth under Item 1.01 of this Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference. The Company offered and sold the Notes to the Initial Purchaser in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), for resale by the Initial Purchaser to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Company relied on these exemptions from registration based in part on representations made by the Initial Purchaser in a Purchase Agreement.

However, any failure by the Company to give such notice to all of the Holders, or any defect in the notice, will not impair or affect the validity of the modification or amendment.Section 6.01 Section 8.04.                            Effect of Supplemental Indentures. Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article VIII, this Indenture, the Notes, if applicable, shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture and the Notes, if applicable, as the case may be, for all purposes; and every Holder of Notes theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby.

Section 8.07.                            Revocation and Effect of Consents and Waivers. A consent to an amendment or a waiver by a Holder of a Note shall bind the Holder and every subsequent Holder of that Note or portion of the Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder\\'s Note, even if notation of the consent or waiver is not made on the Note.  However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent or waiver as to such Holder\\'s Note or portion of the Note if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the amendment or waiver becomes effective.  After an amendment or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder.  An amendment or waiver made pursuant to shall become effective upon receipt by the Trustee of the requisite number of written consents.Section 8.02 The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to give their consent or take any other action described above or required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this Indenture.

No such consent shall become valid or effective more than 120 days after such record date. Section 8.08.                            Notation on or Exchange of Notes. If an amendment changes the terms of a Note, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Note to deliver it to the Trustee.  The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Note regarding the changed terms and return it to the Holder.  Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Note shall issue and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall authenticate a new Note that reflects the changed terms.  Failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new Note shall not affect the validity of such amendment. Section 9.01.                            Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets.

Conversion Privilege. (a)                                 Upon compliance with the provisions of this Article X, a Holder of Notes shall have the right, at such Holder\\'s option, to convert all or any portion (if the portion to be converted is $1,000 principal amount or an integral multiple thereof) of such Note at any time prior to the Close of Business on the scheduled Business Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date at a rate (the \"\") of 82.3451 shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustment by the Company as provided in ) per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares (collectively, the \"\").Conversion RateSection 10.04Conversion Obligation (b)                                (1)                                 If and only to the extent a Noteholder elects to convert Notes prior to the Maturity Date in connection with a transaction described in clause (a), clause (c) (without reference to subclause (iii) thereunder) or clause (d) of the definition of Fundamental Change pursuant to which 10% or more of the consideration for the Common Stock (other than cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments made in respect of dissenters\\' appraisal rights) in such transaction consists of cash or securities (or other property) that are not shares ofcommon stock traded or scheduled to be traded immediately following such transaction on the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Marker or the NASDAQ Global Select Market (or any of their respective successors), referred to herein as a \"\", then the Conversion Rate applicable to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes so converted shall be increased by an additional number of shares of Common Stock (the \"\") as described in Section 10.01(b)(2) below.  The Company shall notify Holders of the anticipated Effective Date of a Non-Stock Change of Control no later than such time that the Non-Stock Change of Control occurs.  Settlement of Notes tendered for conversion to which Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate as provided in this subsection shall be settled pursuant to below, as applicable.  For purposes of this , a conversion of Notes shall be deemed to be \"in connection with\" a Non-Stock Change of Control to the extent that the related conversion notice is received by the Conversion Agent following the Effective Date of the Non-Stock Change of Control but before the Close of Business on the Business Day immediately preceding the related Fundamental Change Repurchase Date.  Such conversion notice shall indicate that the Holder of Notes has elected to convert Notes in connection with a Non-Stock Change of Control; , , that the failure to so indicate shall not in any way affect the Conversion Obligation or the right of such Holder to receive Additional Shares in connection with such conversion.Non-Stock Change of ControlAdditional SharesSection 10.02Section 10.01(b)providedhowever (2)                                 The number of Additional Shares by which the Conversion Rate will be increased shall be determined by reference to the table attached as Schedule A hereto, based on the date on which the Non-Stock Change of Control occurs or becomes effective (the \"\"), and the Stock Price; , that if the Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts in the table attached as hereto or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table attached as hereto, the number of Additional Shares shall be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Price amounts and the two Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 360-day year; that if (x) the Stock Price is in excess of $16.00 per share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in ), no Additional Shares will be added to the Conversion Rate, and (y) the Stock Price is less than $11.04 per share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in ), no Additional Shares will be added to the Conversion Rate.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion, as adjusted pursuant to this Section 10.01(b)(2), exceed 90.5797 per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, subject to the same adjustments as the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 10.04.Effective DateprovidedSchedule ASchedule Aprovided furtherSection 10.04Section 10.04 The number of Additional Shares within the table in hereto shall be adjusted in the same manner as and as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted as set forth in (other than by operation of an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this ). The Stock Prices set forth in the first row of the table attached as hereto (i.e., the column headers) shall be simultaneously adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted (other than by operation of an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this ).  The adjusted Stock Prices shall equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted.Schedule ASection 10.04Section 10.01(b)Schedule ASection 10.01(b) Section 10.02.                      Conversion Procedures. (a)                                 Each Note shall be convertible at the office of the Conversion Agent and, if applicable, in accordance with the Applicable Procedures. (b)                                In order to exercise the conversion privilege with respect to any interest in a Global Note, the Holder must complete the appropriate instruction form for conversion pursuant to the Depositary\\'s book-entry conversion program, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the Company or the Conversion Agent, pay all taxes or duties, if any, for which the Holder is responsible pursuant to , and the Conversion Agent must be informed of the conversion in accordance with the customary practice of the Depositary.  In order to exercise the conversion privilege with respect to any certificated Notes, the Holder of any such Notes to be converted, in whole or in part, shall:Section 4.06 (i)                                    complete and manually sign the conversion notice provided on the back of the Note and attached hereto as (the \"\") or a facsimile of the Conversion Notice;Exhibit BConversion Notice (ii)                                 deliver the completed Conversion Notice, which is irrevocable, and the Note to the Conversion Agent; (iii)                              if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents; and (iv)                             if required, pay all taxes or duties pursuant to .Section 4.06 The date on which the Holder satisfies all of the applicable requirements set forth in this  is the \".\"  The Conversion Agent will provide the Company with notice of any conversion by a Holder of the Notes on the Conversion Date (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be the next Business Day if the applicable requirements are satisfied after the Close of Business on a Business Day and prior to the open of Business on the next Business Day).Section 10.02(b)Conversion Date (c)                                 Each Conversion Notice shall state the name or names (with address or addresses) in which any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock which shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be issued.  All such Notes surrendered for conversion shall, unless the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion are to be issued in the same name as the registration of such Notes, be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed by, the Holder or his duly authorized attorney. (d)                                In case any certificated Notes of a denomination greater than $1,000 shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of the Notes so surrendered, without charge, new Notes in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Notes. Each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as to any such Notes (or portionthereof) surrendered for conversion immediately prior to the Close of Business on the relevant Conversion Date.  The person in whose name the certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock that shall be issuable upon such conversion shall become the holder of record of such shares of Common Stock as of the Close of Business on such Conversion Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything contained in this Indenture to the contrary, in no event shall a Holder be entitled to the benefit of a Conversion Rate adjustment pursuant to the provisions of hereof in respect of Notes surrendered for conversion if, by virtue of being deemed the record holder of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion pursuant to the foregoing sentence, such Holder participates, as a result of being such holder of record, in the transaction or event that would otherwise give rise to such Conversion Rate adjustment to the same extent and in the same manner as holders of shares of Common Stock generally.Article X (e)                                 Upon the conversion of an interest in Global Notes, the Trustee (or other Conversion Agent appointed by the Company) shall make a notation on such Global Notes as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby.  The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversions of Notes effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee. (f)                                   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Note in respect of which a Holder has delivered a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice exercising such Holder\\'s option to require the Company to purchase such Note may be converted only if such Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice is withdrawn in accordance with  hereof.Section 11.01(c) Section 10.03.                      Payments Upon Conversion. (a)                                 Upon any conversion of any Notes, on the third Business Day immediately following the Conversion Date, the Company shall deliver to the converting Holder a number of shares of Common Stock equal to (i) the aggregate principal amount of such Notes to be converted divided by $1,000, multiplied by (ii) the Conversion Rate in effect as of such Conversion Date, together with any cash payment for any fractional share of Common Stock as described in .Section 10.03(c) (b)                                Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture, upon the conversion of any Notes, unless the Holder converts after a Record Date for an interest payment but prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, the Holder will also receive a separate cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest (including Additional Interest and Filing Additional Interest, if any) to, but not including, the Conversion Date.  Any such payment will be made on the settlement date applicable to the relevant conversion of the Notes. (c)                                 The Company shall not issue fractional shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Notes.  If multiple Notes shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares which shall be issuable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted hereby) so surrendered.  If any fractional share of Common Stock would be issuable upon the conversion of any Notes, the Company shall make payment thereforin cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock based on the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the relevant Conversion Date. (d)                                Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture, no Holder of Notes will be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock upon conversion to the extent (but only to the extent) that such receipt would cause such converting Holder to become, directly or indirectly, a \"beneficial owner\" (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) of more than 5.0% of the Common Stock outstanding at such time (the \"\").  Any purported delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Notes shall be void and have no effect to the extent (but only to the extent) that such delivery would result in the converting Holder becoming the beneficial owner of more than 5.0% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time.  If any delivery of shares of Common Stock owed to a Holder upon conversion of Notes is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of the Limitation, the Company\\'s obligation to make such delivery shall not be extinguished and the Company shall deliver such shares as promptly as practicable after any such converting Holder gives notice to the Company that such delivery would not result in it being the beneficial owner of more than 5.0% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time.  The Limitation shall no longer apply following the Effective Date of any Fundamental Change.Limitation Section 10.04.                      Adjustment of Conversion Rate. The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows: (a)                                 If the Company issues shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of Common Stock, or effects a share split or share combination, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula: where CR1                          =                                        the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Opening of Business on the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such share split or combination, as the case may be; CR0                          =                                        the Conversion Rate in effect at Close of Business on the Trading Day immediately preceding the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such share split or combination, as the case may be; OS0                          =                                        the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at Close of Business on the Trading Day immediately preceding the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such share split or combination; andOS1                          =                                        the number of shares of Common Stock that would be outstanding immediately after, and solely as a result of, such dividend, distribution, share split or combination, as the case may be. Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the Opening of Business on the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such share split or combination, as the case may be.  If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this  is declared but not so paid or made, or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not subdivided or combined, as the case may be, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, or subdivide or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination had not been declared.Section 10.04(a) (b)                                In case the Company shall issue to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock any rights or warrants (other than rights issued pursuant to a shareholders\\' rights plan) entitling them for a period of not more than 60 days from the issuance date for such distribution to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock, at a price per share less than the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date of such distribution, then the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula: where CR1                          =                                        the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Opening of Business on the record date for such distribution; CR0                          =                                        the Conversion Rate in effect at the Close of Business on the Trading Day immediately preceding the record date for such distribution; OS0                          =                                        the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the Close of Business on the Trading Day immediately preceding the record date for such distribution; X                                      =                                        the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights or warrants; and Y                                       =                                        the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights or warrants, divided by the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the record date for such distribution.Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately prior to the Opening of Business on the record date for such distribution.  If such rights or warrants are not issued or to the extent they are not so exercised prior to their expiration, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such record date for such distribution had not been fixed. In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holder thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date of such distribution, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, where the value of such consideration, if other than cash, shall be determined by the Board of Directors. (c)                                 (i)                                    In case the Company shall distribute shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness or other assets or property to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock (excluding dividends and distributions covered by , , , and distributions described below in  with respect to Spin-Offs (as defined below)) (any of such shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness or other asset or property hereinafter in this  called the \"\"), then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:Section 10.04(a)Section 10.04(b)Section 10.04(d)Section 10.04(c)(ii)Section 10.04(c)Distributed Property where CR1                          =                                        the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Opening of Business on the record date for such distribution; CR0                          =                                        the Conversion Rate in effect at the Close of Business on the Trading Day immediately preceding the record date for such distribution; SP0                            =                                        the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the record date for such distribution; and FMV                    =                                        the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof) of the Distributed Property distributed with respect to each outstanding share of Common Stock as of the Opening of Business on the record date for such distribution.Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the Opening of Business on the record date for shareholders entitled to receive such distribution; that (1) if the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the Distributed Property so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than SPprovided0as set forth above or (2) if SP0 exceeds the fair market value of the Distributed Property by less than $0.01, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes upon conversion, the amount of Distributed Property such Holder would have received had such Holder converted such Notes immediately prior to the record date for determining the shareholders of the Company entitled to receive the Distributed Property.  If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.  If such dividend or distribution consists of rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the extent that such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration.  If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 10.04(c)(i) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in determining SP0 above. (ii)                                 With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this  where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock in shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company that are listed on a national or regional securities exchange (a \"\"), then the Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:Section 10.04(c)Spin-Off  where CR1                          =                                        the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Opening of Business on the record date for the Spin-Off; CR0                          =                                        the Conversion Rate in effect at the Close of Business, on the Trading Day immediately preceding the record date for the Spin-Off; FMV                    =                                        the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Capital Stock or other similar equity interest distributed to holders of Common Stock applicable to one share of Common Stock over the first 10 consecutive Trading Day period immediately following, and including, the third Trading Day after the record date for such Spin-Off (such period, the \"\"); andValuation Period MP0                       =                                        the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock over the Valuation Period.Such adjustment shall occur immediately after the Opening of Business on the day after the last day of the Valuation Period but will be given effect as of the Opening of Business on the record date for the Spin-Off; that in respect of any conversion within the ten Trading Days following any Spin-Off, references within this  to ten Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between such Spin-Off and the Conversion Date in determining the applicable Conversion Rate.  Because the Company will make the adjustment to the Conversion Rate at the end of the Valuation Period with retroactive effect, the Company will delay the settlement of any Notes where the Conversion Date occurs during the Valuation Period.  In such event, the Company will deliver shares of Common Stock and any cash in lieu thereof (based on the adjusted Conversion Rate) on the third Business Day following the last day of the Valuation Period.providedSection 10.04(c)(ii) Rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of Common Stock, entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase Capital Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (\"\"):  (i) are deemed to be transferred with such Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this  (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this  will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this .  If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof).  In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued.Trigger EventSection 10.04(c)Section 10.04(c)Section 10.04(c)Section 10.04 For purposes of this  and  and , any dividend or distribution to which this  is applicable that also includes a dividend or distribution of Common Stock to which  applies or a dividend or distribution of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock to which  or  applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution ofSection 10.04(c)Section 10.04(a)Section 10.04(b)Section 10.04(c)Section 10.04(a)Section 10.04(a)Section 10.04(b)the evidences of indebtedness, assets or shares of Capital Stock other than such Common Stock or rights or warrants to which this  applies, and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this  with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made, immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such Common Stock or such rights or warrants (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by  and  with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except (A) the record date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as \"the record date\" and \"the date fixed for such determination\" within the meaning of  and  and (B) any Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed outstanding \"at Close of Business on the Trading Day immediately preceding the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such share split or combination\" within the meaning of  or \"at Close of Business on the Trading Day immediately preceding the record for such distribution\" within the meaning of .Section 10.04(c)Section 10.04(c)Section 10.04(a)Section 10.04(b)Section 10.04(a)Section 10.04(b)Section 10.04(a)Section 10.04(b) (d)                                In case the Company shall pay any cash dividends or make distributions paid exclusively in cash to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock (other than dividends or distributions made in connection with the dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company or distributions to which applies), then the Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:Section 10.06  where CR1                          =                                        the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Opening of Business on the record date for such dividend or distribution; CR0                          =                                        the Conversion Rate in effect at the Close of Business, on the Trading Day immediately preceding the record date for such distribution; SP0                            =                                        the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the record date for such distribution; DTA                    =                                        the dividend threshold amount, which will initially be equal to $0.1016per share in any month; that if there is not a record date for a dividend in any month, the DTA may be carried forward by the Company to the next subsequent month, and to the extent the aggregate amount of any dividends with record dates in such subsequent month is less than $0.1016 such difference may be carried forward to the second subsequent month, subject to a maximum DTA at any time of $0.3048; andprovidedC                                       =                                        the amount in cash per share that the Company distributes to holders of Common Stock in any dividend. Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the Opening of Business on the record date for such dividend or distribution. The dividend threshold amount is subject to adjustment on an inversely proportional basis whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted other than pursuant to this .  If an adjustment is required to be made as set forth in this  as a result of a distribution that is not a regular monthly or quarterly dividend, the dividend threshold amount will be deemed to be zero.  For the avoidance of doubt, a distribution that relates to a prior monthly or quarterly period during which the record date for a regular distribution did not occur (such distribution, a \"\") shall constitute a regular monthly or quarterly dividend (whether paid separately or together with the regular monthly or quarterly distribution with respect to the period in which such Delayed Distribution occurs), notwithstanding the fact that the record date for such Delayed Distribution occurs after the monthly or quarterly period to which the Delayed Distribution relates.Section 10.04(d)Section 10.04(d)Delayed Distribution If \"C\" (as defined above) is equal to or greater than \"SP0\" (as defined above), or if the difference between \"SP0\" and \"C\" is less than $0.01, in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder of a Note shall receive, in respect of each $1,000 principal amount thereof, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of shares of Common Stock, the amount of cash that such Holder would have received as if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the record date for such cash dividend or distribution. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this , in the event of any reclassification of the Common Stock, as aresult of which the Notes become convertible into more than one class of Common Stock, if an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required pursuant to this , references in this  to one share of Common Stock or Last Reported Sale Price of one share of Common Stock shall be deemed to refer to a unit or to the price of a unit consisting of the number of shares of each class of Common Stock into which the Notes are then convertible equal to the number of shares of such class issued in respect of one share of Common Stock in such reclassification.  The above provisions of this paragraph shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications.Section 10.04(d)Section 10.04(d)Section 10.04(d) (e)                                 In case the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for Common Stock, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, then the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula: whereCR1                          =                                        the Conversion Rate in effect at the Close of Business on the day such tender offer or exchange offer expires; CR0                          =                                        the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Opening of Business on the Trading Day immediately following the day such tender offer or exchange offer expires; AC                             =                                        the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof) paid or payable for shares purchased in such tender or exchange offer; SP1                            =                                        the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the day such tender or exchange offer expires (the \"\");Averaging Period OS1                          =                                        the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the Close of Business on the day such tender or exchange offer expires (after giving effect to such tender offer or exchange offer); and OS0                          =                                        the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the date such tender or exchange offer expires (prior to giving effect to such tender offer or exchange offer). Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the Opening of Business on the day following the last day of the Averaging Period, but will be given effect as of the Opening of Business on the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender offer or exchange offer expires.  Because the Company will make the adjustment to the Conversion Rate at the end of the Averaging Period with retroactive effect, the Company will delay the settlement of any Notes where the Conversion Date occurs during the Averaging Period.  In such event, the Company will deliver shares of Common Stock and any cash in lieu thereof (based on the adjusted Conversion Rate) on the third Business Day immediately following the last day of the Averaging Period. (f)                                   Notwithstanding any other provision of this , no adjustments to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this will be made:Section 10.04Section 10.04 (i)                                    upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan or similar arrangement providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company\\'s securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any such plan or arrangement; (ii)                                 upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase such shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program or similar arrangement of, or assumed by, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;(iii)                              upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not described in clause (ii) of this  and outstanding as of the date the Notes were first issued;Section 10.04(f) (iv)                             for a change in the par value of the Common Stock; or (v)                                for accrued and unpaid interest (including Additional Interest and Filing Additional Interest, if any).

No adjustment shall be made for the Company\\'s issuance of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, or the right to purchase Common Stock or such convertible or exchangeable securities, other than as provided in this .  No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Rate unless such adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the Conversion Rate then in effect at such time.  The Company shall carry forward any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate, take such carried-forward adjustments into account in any subsequent adjustment, and make such carried forward adjustments, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1%, (i) annually on the anniversary of the first date of issue of the Notes and otherwise, (ii) upon any conversion of the Notes, and (iii) (1) 10 Business Days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes (whether at Stated Maturity or otherwise) or (2) 10 Business Days prior to any Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, unless such adjustment has already been made.Article XSection 12.15Section 10.04 (j)                                    Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee an Officers\\' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.  The Trustee and Conversion Agent may conclusively rely on the accuracy of the Conversion Rate adjustment provided by the Company.  Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers\\' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect.  Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shallprepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and provide notice to Holders of such adjustment.

We have reported to accreditors what we should; implemented extensive corrective measures to address any issues found; and have now closed the door on the review.\"\"While we expect a challenging business and reputational year ahead, we have put a new strategy in place to deal with our current challenges and position ourselves for success beyond 2012. It\\'s time for Career Education to reinvent itself for the future and resume a leadership position in higher education,\" Lesnik said.The Company believes it is useful to present non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain significant items, as a means to understand the performance of its core business.
